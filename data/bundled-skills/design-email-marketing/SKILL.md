# Email Marketing

Use this skill when creating email campaigns, writing newsletters, designing automated sequences, or planning SMS reminders for e-commerce.

## Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `toolkit_cpt` (action: `list_items` on `mcp_ai_customer`) | Query customer records for segmentation — filter by purchase history, last order date, lifetime value |
| `toolkit_cpt` (action: `list_items` on `mcp_ai_lead`) | Query leads for prospect outreach — filter by status, source, score |
| `toolkit_cpt` (action: `get_schema` on `mcp_ai_customer` / `mcp_ai_lead`) | Discover available CRM fields before querying customer or lead records |
| `create_post_validated` | Create email newsletter drafts as WordPress posts for review |
| `paper_store_write` | Save email templates and sequences to the Paper Store for reuse |
| `nv_oos_*_agent_remote_wp_connection` | Pull customer/order data from remote WooCommerce sites for email targeting |

> **CRM note:** Use `design-crm` to manage the full customer and lead lifecycle — this skill focuses on email content and segmentation, not CRM record management.

## WP-CLI Commands

Key `mcp-ai` WP-CLI commands for email workflows. Run via `terminal`:

| Command | Use for |
|---|---|
| `wp mcp-ai cron` | Check scheduled email campaigns |
| `wp mcp-ai bulk` | Batch process email templates |
| `wp mcp-ai log` | View email send success/failure logs |

## When to use this skill

Trigger when ANY of the following is true:

- Creating a newsletter, promotional email, or announcement.
- Setting up an automated email sequence (welcome, abandoned cart, post-purchase).
- Writing SMS reminders for sales, launches, or events.
- The task mentions "email blast", "newsletter", "drip campaign", or "email sequence".
- Planning email content aligned with a monthly marketing calendar.
- The task asks to "send an email to customers" or "notify subscribers".
- Designing abandoned cart recovery flows.
- Creating customer segmentation strategies for targeted sends.

Every marketing email should have these components:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  FROM: [Brand Name]             │  Recognizable sender

│  HERO IMAGE / GIF               │  Visual hook — product, lifestyle
│                                 │
│  HEADLINE                       │  Reinforce subject line
│                                 │
│  BODY COPY (2–3 short blocks)   │  Value, details, social proof
│                                 │
│  CTA BUTTON (primary)           │  One clear action
│                                 │
│  SECONDARY CTA (optional)       │  Browse, learn more, follow
│                                 │

### Subject Line Formulas

| Type | Formula | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Curiosity** | "The [thing] everyone's asking about" | "The scent everyone noticed at that wedding" |
| **Urgency** | "[Time limit] — [what's at stake]" | "48 hours — then this price is gone" |
| **Personal** | "[Name], [personal observation]" | "Nadini, your skin will thank you" |
| **Listicle** | "[Number] ways to [benefit]" | "3 fragrances that last through monsoon" |
| **Question** | "Ever wonder [intriguing question]?" | "Ever wonder why French perfumes smell different?" |
| **Sneak Peek** | "Just dropped: [product/category]" | "Just dropped: Swarovski's new collection" |
| **Social Proof** | "Everyone's [action] this [product]" | "Sri Lanka's top-selling luxury scent" |

**Rules:**
- 30–50 characters (mobile-optimized)
- No ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation (spam filters)
- Front-load the key words (first 30 chars show in mobile preview)
- A/B test two variants per send

## Newsletter Structure (Monthly Digest)

Sent once per month to all subscribers. Aligns with the monthly campaign theme.

```
SUBJECT: "[Month] at The Parfumerie — [Theme Hook]"

Section 1: HERO STORY
  "This month, we're celebrating [theme]."
  Primary product or collection feature with image + CTA.

Section 2: WHAT'S NEW
  2–3 new arrivals or restocked favorites.
  Each: small image, name, one-line description, price, "Shop Now".

Section 3: EDITOR'S PICK
  One staff-favorite product with personal note.
  "Sophie's pick: [Product] because [reason]."

Section 4: GIFTING IDEA
  Curated suggestion tied to occasion or season.
  "Need a gift? [Bundle name] — Rs. X. Gift wrapped, delivered."

Section 5: REMINDERS
  ● Free islandwide delivery on all orders
  ● Complimentary gift wrapping
  ● E-gift vouchers available (link)

FOOTER CTA: "Follow us on Instagram @theparfumerie.lk"
```

## Promotional Email Sequence

For sales, launches, or special events, use a 3-email sequence:

### Email 1: Teaser (24–48 hours before)

```
Subject: "Something's coming... 👀"
Tone: Mysterious, exciting
Content: Minimal. One hero image, one line of intrigue.
         "Thursday. 10 AM. Be ready."
CTA: "Set a reminder" (calendar link) or "Browse collection" (soft tease)
```

### Email 2: Launch (Day of, 10 AM)

```
Subject: "It's here: [Product / Sale Name]"
Tone: Energetic, celebratory
Content: Full reveal. Hero product image, 3 key benefits,
         price with discount shown, urgency note ("limited stock").
CTA: "Shop Now" (prominent button above the fold)
```

### Email 3: Last Chance (24 hours before end)

```
Subject: "⏳ Last chance — [Product/Sale] ends tomorrow"
Tone: Urgent but not desperate
Content: Social proof ("X sold already"), what they'll miss,
         answer objections ("Free returns", "Islandwide delivery").
CTA: "Don't miss out" or "Get yours before it's gone"
```

## Abandoned Cart Recovery

### Timing

| Email | When | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Email 1** | 1 hour after abandon | Gentle reminder — "Did you forget something?" |
| **Email 2** | 24 hours after | Add social proof — reviews, ratings, popularity |
| **Email 3** | 72 hours after | Incentive — small discount or free delivery |

### Copy Formulas

**Email 1 — Gentle Nudge:**
```
Subject: "Your [product] is waiting..."
Body: "Hi [Name], we noticed you left something behind.
       [Product name] — [one-line description].
       Your cart is saved for now, but stock moves fast.
       Ready to complete your order?"
CTA: "Return to Cart"
```

**Email 2 — Social Proof:**
```
Subject: "People love this [product category]"
Body: "Still thinking about [product]?
       ★★★★★ '[Real customer review quote]'
       [2-3 short review snippets]
       It's a favorite for a reason."
CTA: "See What You're Missing"
```

**Email 3 — Incentive (use sparingly):**
```
Subject: "A little something to help you decide 🎁"
Body: "We'd love for you to experience [product].
       Here's [X% off / free delivery] — just because.
       Valid for 24 hours on your saved cart."
CTA: "Claim Your Discount"
```

## Welcome Sequence (New Subscribers)

5-email sequence over 2 weeks:

```
Day 0:  WELCOME + OFFER
        "Welcome to The Parfumerie — here's 10% off your first order"
        Introduce the brand, set expectations, deliver the discount code.

Day 2:  BRAND STORY
        "The story behind your new favorite fragrance destination"
        Why we exist, Sri Lankan roots, curation philosophy.

Day 4:  BESTSELLERS
        "Sri Lanka's most-loved scents (see what everyone's buying)"
        Top 5 products with reviews, social proof.

Day 7:  HOW WE'RE DIFFERENT
        "Gift wrapping, islandwide delivery, and real authenticity"
        Service differentiators — the experience beyond the product.

Day 14: LAST CHANCE + ENGAGE
        "Your 10% code expires soon — plus, follow us on Instagram"
        Urgency on discount + social follow CTA.
```

## SMS Reminders

Use SMS sparingly — only for time-sensitive, high-value events:

| Use Case | When | Max Length |
|---|---|---|
| Flash sale alert | 2 hours before | 160 chars |
| Launch reminder | Morning of | 160 chars |
| Back-in-stock | Immediately | 160 chars |
| Order update | Real-time | 160 chars |
| Abandoned cart | 4 hours after | 160 chars |

### SMS Copy (160-character constraint)

```
"FLASH SALE: 25% off all fragrances at The Parfumerie.
Today only. Shop now: [short link] Reply STOP to opt out."

"Your order #12345 is out for delivery! 🚚
Track it here: [short link]"

"Good news — [Product] is back in stock.
But only [X] units left. [short link]"
```

**SMS rules:**
- Always include opt-out ("Reply STOP")
- Never send after 8 PM local time
- Maximum 2 promotional SMS per month
- Link to mobile-optimized landing page

## Segmentation Strategy

Divide your list to send relevant content:

| Segment | Criteria | Send |
|---|---|---|
| **Fragrance lovers** | Purchased perfume | New fragrance launches, layering tips |
| **Skincare enthusiasts** | Purchased skincare | New skincare, routines, seasonal tips |
| **Gift buyers** | Purchased gift cards or "gift" orders | Gifting guides, voucher promos, occasions |
| **High-value** | 2+ orders, total > Rs. 15,000 | Early access, VIP offers, personal notes |
| **Dormant** | No open/click in 90 days | Re-engagement: "We miss you" + incentive |
| **New subscribers** | Joined < 30 days ago | Welcome sequence (see above) |

## Timing & Calendar Integration

Align email sends with the monthly campaign calendar:

```
Monthly Digest:    1st of each month (aligns with campaign launch)
New Arrival Alert:  Day of product drop (coordinated with social posts)
Flash Sale:         Friday 8 AM (teaser) → Saturday 10 AM (launch)
Abandoned Cart:     Automated (always on)
Welcome Sequence:   Automated (triggered on signup)
Re-engagement:      Middle of month (between campaigns)
```

**Weekly email cap:** Maximum 3 promotional emails per week per subscriber. Automated/transactional emails don't count toward this cap.

## Email Copy Principles

1. **One goal per email** — don't promote a sale, a new arrival, and a blog post in one email. Pick one CTA.
2. **Mobile-first** — 60%+ opens are on phones. Short paragraphs, large buttons (44px+), single-column layout.
3. **Front-load value** — the reason to care should be visible without scrolling.
4. **Write like a person** — "We think you'll love this" not "The Parfumerie is pleased to announce."
5. **Use the customer's language** — mirror how they describe products in reviews and messages.
6. **Preview text matters** — the preheader is the second subject line. Use it.
7. **Segment or be ignored** — a blanket email to everyone performs worse than a targeted one to a segment.

## Common Mistakes

```
WRONG:
- "CLICK HERE NOW!!! 50% OFF EVERYTHING!!!" (spam filter bait)
- Sending a 2,000-word newsletter with 8 CTAs
- Blasting "Happy Women's Day" to male subscribers
- No unsubscribe link (illegal in most jurisdictions)
- Sending from "noreply@theparfumerie.lk" (kills engagement)
- SMS at 11 PM (anger + opt-outs)

RIGHT:
- "Your weekend scent, sorted. 20% off — today only."
- One hero product, one CTA, clear value proposition
- Segment by purchase history and interest
- Clear unsubscribe link in every email footer
- Send from "Sophie at The Parfumerie" (personal touch)
- SMS before 8 PM, maximum 2/month promotional
```

## Critical Rules

- **Segment before you send** — use purchase history, browsing behavior, and engagement to target.
- **One CTA per email** — clarity beats choice. The reader should never wonder what to do next.
- **Mobile-first design** — single column, large text, thumb-friendly buttons.
- **Always include unsubscribe** — it's not optional; it's the law.
- **A/B test subject lines** — the subject determines whether the email gets opened at all.
- **Align with social calendar** — email and social should feel like one coordinated campaign, not two separate things.
- **SMS is for urgency only** — don't dilute SMS with routine content. Save it for sales, launches, and time-sensitive alerts.
- **Track and iterate** — open rate, click rate, conversion rate. Feed performance back into segmentation and content decisions.

## What This Skill Does NOT Cover

- **Social media publishing** — use `design-social-publishing` for posting content to Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X, or LinkedIn.
- **CRM contact management** — use `design-crm` for managing customer, lead, and company records (via `toolkit_cpt` on `mcp_ai_customer`, `mcp_ai_lead`).
- **Campaign orchestration** — use `design-campaign-orchestration` to build the monthly marketing calendar that emails align with.
- **SMS-only workflows** — use `design-communications` for transactional SMS and chat-based customer interactions.
- **Analytics and performance tracking** — use `design-analytics-reporting` to measure open rates, click rates, and conversion data.
- **Content creation for social/website** — use `design-social-content` or `design-content-research` for non-email content.

## Cross-references

- Run **`design-campaign-orchestration`** to align email sends with the monthly marketing calendar.
- Run **`design-content-calendar`** to schedule email sends alongside social posts.
- Run **`design-social-content`** for copywriting principles that apply across channels.
- Run **`design-product-research`** to gather product details for email features.
- Run **`design-brand-kit`** to ensure email visuals and tone match brand guidelines.
- Run **`design-image-generation`** to create email hero images — check your tool list for the Gemini image tool.
- Run **`design-crm`** to manage customer and lead records — use `toolkit_cpt` on `mcp_ai_customer` and `mcp_ai_lead` for segmentation data.
